# PS-1: Product Landing Page

## About This Project
Hey, I built this landing page for a fitness tracker called FitWatch. It's my way of practicing HTML, CSS, and responsive design. I included a navbar, hero section, features grid, user feedback, and a footer. Added some bonus elements like hover effects to make it engaging.

## What I Included
- **Navbar**: With links and a mobile-friendly hamburger menu.
- **Hero Banner**: Big headline, subtext, and CTA buttons that scale on hover.
- **Features**: Showed 4 key attributes in a grid with prices.
- **Footer**: Links and social icons.
- **Responsiveness**: Used media queries to make it work on all devices.
- **Bonus**: Added a feedback section with styled cards.

## My Thoughts
This was a fun project! I learned a lot about Flexbox and Grid. If I were to improve it, I'd add more animations or real data for feedback.

I was not able to complete the second ps that's why i am submitting the only one ps.
